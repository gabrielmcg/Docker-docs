<body>
 
<p>An overview of all the playbooks is available <xref href="../playbooks-overview.dita">here</xref>. This section outlines the changes 
    from the previous release of the playbooks.</p>
 
<p>The playbooks that were available previously as part of the <codeph>Dev Edition</codeph> have been removed in this release, leaving a 
single codebase that currently focuses on operations functionality. Some of the development-specific stacks may be reinstated in a future release.</p>
<p/> 
    
<p>Windows-specific playbooks have now been merged into the core, so running <codeph>site.yml</codeph> will automatically install
Windows workers, if they are declared in the inventory. Non-core playbooks such as those for the monitoring stacks will automatically install
any required Windows software.
</p>    
    
<p>The playbooks that are specific to <ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> and related to backup have been redesigned:</p>
    
<ul>
<li><codeph>playbooks/config_dummy_vms_for_docker_volumes_backup.yml</codeph> now uses the same mechanism as the 
    <codeph>playbooks/create_vms.yml</codeph> to deploy the dummy VM.</li>   
    
<li><codeph>playbooks/config_simplivity_backups.yml</codeph> has been refactored to be more modular, with separate plays for
creating backup policies, populating policies with rules, and assigning backup policies to VMs. The reliability of the 
playbook has been improved by minimizing the number of concurrent operations to the least number of nodes possible. The playbook 
creates the policies based on the <codeph>backup_policies</codeph> data structure in the <codeph>group_vars/vars</codeph> file.
Any exisiting policies will not be over-written when running the playbook, but rules attached to the policies will be updated
based on the information supplied in the variables file. If you omit the <codeph>node_policy</codeph> variable for a group of nodes,
 no policy will be assigned by default.
</li>
</ul>
       
    
<p><codeph>playbooks/config_storage_driver.yml</codeph> prepares drives for local Docker volumes and container images
    and configures the Docker storage driver based on the value of the <codeph>docker_storage_driver</codeph> variable
    in <codeph>group_vars/vars</codeph>.
</p>    
  
<p>The <codeph>scale_worker.sh</codeph> utility script has been updated to support the new load balancers as well as the legacy ones.</p>
