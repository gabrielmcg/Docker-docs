<title><ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> configuration</title>
<body>
<p>The Ansible playbooks are available to download at 
<ph conkeyref="conrefs/gitrepo-link"/>. 
By default, the  playbooks  are configured as shown in <xref href="../solution-config.dita#solution-config/architecture-3node" type="fig"/> to set up a 3 node environment. This is the 
minimal starter configuration recommended by HPE and Docker for 
production. 
</p>

<p>The Operations environment is comprised of three <ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> 380 Gen10 servers. 
    HPE recommends dual socket <ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> systems with at least 14 CPU cores per socket (28 total cores per system) 
    for optimal performance and support during HA failover scenarios. Since the <ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> technology 
    relies on VMware virtualization, the servers are managed using vCenter. <!--The load among the three hosts will 
    be shared as per Figure TODO.-->
<!-- TODO Add link to figure for load across hosts -->
