<p>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) refers to the time that it takes to recover your data and
            applications while Recovery Point Objective (RPO) refers to the point in time you can
            recover to, in the event of a disaster. In essence, RPO tells you how often you will
            need to make new backups. </p>
    
<p>In order to protect your installation from disasters, you need to take regular backups and 
transfer the backups to a safe location. This solution provides
a range of convenience scripts and Ansible playbooks to help automate the backup of UCP, DTR, your swarm and your Docker volumes.
See the section <xref href="backup-restore.dita">Backup and restore</xref> for best practices, procedures and utilities for
implementing disaster recovery.
