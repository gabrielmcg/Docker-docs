<title>Backing up DTR data (images)</title>
<body>


<p>To make a backup of the images that are inventoried in DTR and stored on the NFS server, use <codeph>playbooks/backup_dtr_images.yml</codeph> </p>  

<codeblock># ansible-playbook -i vm_host playbooks/backup_dtr_images.yml</codeblock>  

<p>This playbook creates two archives in the folder specified by the variable
<codeph>backup_dest</codeph> in <codeph>group_vars/backups</codeph>. By default, the files
are named using the following pattern:</p>

<codeblock>&lt;backup_dest>/backup_dtr_data_&lt;replica_id>_&lt;vmname>_&lt;timestamp>.tgz
&lt;backup_dest>/backup_dtr_data_&lt;replica_id>_&lt;vmname>_&lt;timestamp>.vars.tgz</codeblock>

<p><codeph>&lt;replica_id></codeph> is the ID of the DTR replica that was backed up,
<codeph>&lt;vmname></codeph> is the name of the host (in the inventory) that was used to
take the backup, and <codeph>&lt;timestamp></codeph> is the time at which the backup was
taken.</p>  

<p>You can override the generated file names by defining the variable <b>backup_name</b> on the
command line when running the playbook, as shown in the example below: </p>
    
<codeblock># ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts playbooks/backup_dtr_images.yml -e backup_name=<b>my_dtr_data_backup</b></codeblock>
    
<p>The generated files won't have <codeph>&lt;vmname></codeph> or
<codeph>&lt;timestamp></codeph> appended:</p>

<codeblock>&lt;backup_dest>/my_dtr_data_backup.tgz
&lt;backup_dest>/my_dtr_data_backup.vars.tgz</codeblock>  

<p>For more information on DTR backups, see the Docker documentation at
