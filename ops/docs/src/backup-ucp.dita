<p>To make a backup of UCP, use <codeph>playbook/backup_ucp.yml</codeph> as follows:</p>
    
<codeblock># ansible-playbook -i vm_host playbooks/backup_ucp.yml</codeblock>

<p>This playbook creates two archives in the folder specified by the variable
<codeph>backup_dest</codeph> in <codeph>group_vars/backups</codeph>. By default, the files
are named using the following pattern:</p>

<codeblock>&lt;backup_dest>/backup_ucp_&lt;ucpid>_&lt;vmname>_&lt;timestamp>.tgz
&lt;backup_dest>/backup_ucp_&lt;ucpid>_&lt;vmname>_&lt;timestamp>.vars.tgz</codeblock>

<p><codeph>&lt;ucpid></codeph> is the ID of the UCP instance,
<codeph>&lt;vmname></codeph> is the name of the host (in the inventory) that was used to
take the backup, and <codeph>&lt;timestamp></codeph> is the time at which the backup was
taken. The file with the extension <codeph>.vars.tgz</codeph> contains information regarding the system which was backed up.</p>

<p>You can override the generated file name by defining the variable <b>backup_name</b> on the
command line when running the playbook. In the example below: </p>
    
<codeblock># ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts playbooks/backup_ucp.yml -e backup_name=<b>my_ucp_backup</b></codeblock>
    
<p>The generated files won't have <codeph>&lt;vmname></codeph> or
<codeph>&lt;timestamp></codeph> appended:</p>

<codeblock>&lt;backup_dest>/my_ucp_backup.tgz
&lt;backup_dest>/my_ucp_backup.vars.tgz</codeblock>

<note type="warning">To create a consistent backup, the backup command <b>temporarily stops the
UCP containers running on the node where the backup is being performed</b>. User resources, such
as services, containers, and stacks are not affected by this operation and will continue
to operate as expected. Any long-lasting <codeph>docker exec</codeph>, <codeph>docker logs</codeph>, <codeph>docker events</codeph>, 
or <codeph>docker attach</codeph> operations on the
affected manager node will be disconnected.</note>

<p>For more information on UCP backup, see the Docker documentation at
<xref href="https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/3.0/guides/admin/backups-and-disaster-recovery/" format="html" scope="external"/></p>
