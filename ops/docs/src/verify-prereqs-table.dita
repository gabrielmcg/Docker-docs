<row>
<entry>Virtual Infrastructure </entry>
<entry>The FQDN of your vCenter server and the name of the Datacenter. You
will also need administrator credentials in order to create templates
and spin up virtual machines. </entry>
</row>
    <!--  conditional content -->
<row>
<entry>L3 Network requirements </entry>
<entry>The name of the SimpliVity cluster and the names of the member of this cluster as 
    they appear in vCenter. You will also need to know the name of the SimpliVity datastore where 
    you want to land the various virtual machines. You may have to create this datastore if you 
    just installed your SimpliVity cluster. In addition, you will need the IP addresses of the 
    OmniStack virtual machines. Finally you will need credentials with admin capabilities for using the 
    OmniStack API. These credentials are typically the same as your vCenter admin credentials.
</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>L3 Network requirements </entry>
<entry>You will need one IP address for each and every VM configured in the
Ansible inventory (see the section <xref href="edit-group-var.dita"/>). The recommended
minimal deployment (Linux-only) configures 13 virtual machines so you
would need to allocate 13 IP addresses to use this example inventory.
You will also need to allocate at least 2 additional addresses for the virtual IPs used by the UCP and DTR loadbalancers.
If you have a hybrid environment with Windows workers, you will need to increase the allocation based on the number of workers.
Note that <b>the Ansible playbooks do not support DHCP</b> so you need static
IP addresses. All the IPs should be in the same subnet. You will also
have to specify the size of the subnet (for example /22 or /24) and the
L3 gateway for this subnet. </entry>
</row>
    
<row>
<entry>DNS </entry>
<entry>You will need to know the IP addresses of your DNS server. In
addition, all the VMs you configure in the inventory must have their
names registered in DNS prior to deployment. In addition, you will need to know the domain name to
use for configuring the virtual machines (such as <codeph>example.com</codeph>)
</entry>
</row>
    
<row>
<entry>NTP Services </entry>
<entry>You need time services configured in your environment. The deployed solution
uses certificates that are time-sensitive. You will need to specify the IP addresses of your time servers
(NTP). </entry>
</row>
    
<row>
<entry>RHEL Subscription </entry>
<entry>A RHEL subscription is required to pull extra packages that are not
on the DVD. </entry>
</row>
    
<row>
<entry>Docker Prerequisites </entry>
<entry>You will need a URL for the official Docker EE software download and
a license file. Refer to the Docker documentation to learn more about
this URL and the licensing requirements at: <xref format="html"
scope="external"
href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ee/rhel/"
>https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ee/rhel/</xref>
in the section entitled “Docker EE repository URL” </entry>
</row>
    
<row>
<entry>Proxy </entry>
<entry>The playbooks pull the Docker packages from the Internet. If your
environment accesses the Internet through a proxy, you will need the
details of the proxy including the fully qualified domain name and the
port number. </entry>
