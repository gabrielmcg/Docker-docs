<title>New features</title>

<p>This release of the <ph conkeyref="conrefs/gitrepo-string"/> playbooks is  based on the recent release of the corresponding 
<ph conkeyref="conrefs/gitrepo-synergy-string"/> playbooks with some specific additions:
</p> 
    
<ul>
<li><b>Load balancers:</b> The playbooks now support load balancers based on VRRP, using <codeph>HAproxy</codeph> and <codeph>keepalived</codeph>.
The solution can be deployed using these loadbalancers, external load balancers, no load balancers or 
the legacy version of standalone load balancers. 
</li>  
    
<li><b>Default storage driver:</b> The default storage driver is now <codeph>overlay2</codeph>, as recommended by Docker. Previously, the
<codeph>devicemapper</codeph> was configured in <codeph>direct-lvm</codeph> mode.</li>    
    
<li><b>Windows workers behind proxy:</b> Windows worker nodes can now be deployed behind a proxy. Simple HTTP proxy support is provided and the playbooks 
do not support any type of authentication with the proxy (on either RHEL or Windows nodes).</li>    

<li><b>Windows boot drive:</b> The OS partition of Windows worker nodes is now resized to occupy all the boot disk, whereas, previously, there would have been some
unallocated space.
</li>
</ul>
