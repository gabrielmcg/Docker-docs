<title>Monitoring with Sysdig</title>
<body>
<p>Sysdig's approach to Docker monitoring uses transparent instrumentation to see inside
containers from the outside, with no need for agents in each container. Metrics from Docker
containers, and from your applications running inside them, are aggregated in real-time across
each service to provide meaningful monitoring dashboards and alerts for your application.
</p>
<p><xref href="sysdig.dita#sysdig/sysdig-arch" type="fig"/> provides an overview of the Sysdig architecture.

<p><b>Sysdig Monitor</b> allows you to analyze response times, application performance metrics,
container and server utilization metrics, and network metrics. You can build dashboards across
applications, micro-services, container and networks, and explore metadata from Docker,
Kubernetes, Mesos and AWS.  For more information, see the

and the <xref href="https://sysdig.teachable.com/p/sysdig-101" format="html" scope="external">Sysdig Monitor 101</xref> training course. </p>

<p><b>Sysdig Secure</b> provides security at the orchestrator as well as the container level.
You create service-aware policies that allow you to take actions (like killing a container) or
send alerts (to Slack, Splunk, etc) whenever a policy violation occurs. All commands are
audited to help you identify anomalous actions, along with taking snapshots of all activities
pre-and-post a policy violation. For more information, see the

<p>The implementation in this solution uses the Software as a Service (SaaS) version of Sysdig.
The playbooks deploy Sysdig Agent software on each UCP, DTR and Linux worker node, as well as the NFS, logger and load balancer VMs
and captured data is relayed back to your Sysdig SaaS Cloud portal. The deployment provides access to a 
90 day try-and-buy, fully featured version of the Sysdig software.</p>

<note type="note">The Sysdig functionality is not turned on by default in this solution - see
the section on Configuration for more information on how to enable Sysdig. 
 For more information on how to access the 90 day try-and-buy version, see the 
 GitHub repository at <ph conkeyref="conrefs/gitrepo-link"/>.
