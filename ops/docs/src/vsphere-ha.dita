<title>Enable vSphere High Availability (HA)</title>
<body>
<p>You must enable vSphere High Availability (HA) to support virtual machine failover during
a HA event such as a host failure. Sufficient CPU and memory resources must be reserved
across the cluster so that all VMs on the affected host(s) can fail over to remaining
available hosts in the cluster. You configure an Admission Control Policy (ACP) to
specify the percentage CPU and memory to reserve on all the hosts in the cluster to
support HA functionality.</p>

<!--  conditional content -->
<p>More information on enabling vSphere HA and configuring Admission Control Policy is available in 
    the <ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> documentation. Log in to the HPE Support Center at 
    <xref href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/support.html" scope="external" format="html"/> 
    and search for “<ph conkeyref="conrefs/hardware-string"/> 380”. The administration guide is listed when you select the User document type.    
</p>

<note type="note">
<p>You should not use the default Admission Control Policy. Instead, you should
calculate the memory and CPU requirements that are specific to your environment.</p>
