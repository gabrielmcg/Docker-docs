<p>
The playbooks are intended to be used to deploy a new environment. You should only use them for Day 0 deployment purposes.
</p>
<p>
The Ansible log is stored in the <codeph>ops</codeph> folder of the repo (<codeph>/root/Docker-Synergy/ops</codeph>). 
    If the deployment fails, you may find useful hints in this log.
</p>

<p>To see how to check if your certs have been deployed correctly, see Appendix D.</p>
