<p>
The playbooks are intended to be used to deploy a new environment. You should only use them for Day 0 deployment purposes.
</p>
<p>
The Ansible log is stored in the folder <codeph>/root/<ph conkeyref="conrefs/gitrepo-string"/></codeph>. 
    If the deployment fails, you may find useful hints in this log.
</p>

<p>To see how to check if your certs have been deployed correctly, see Appendix D.</p>
