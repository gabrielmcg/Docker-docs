<title>Deploying RHEL workers</title>
<body>
  
<p>By default, <codeph>site.yml</codeph> will automatically deploy any RHEL (and / or Windows) worker nodes that are declared in the inventory. 
</p>
  
<p>
If you subsequently want additional RHEL worker nodes, add them to the inventory as appropriate and 
then run the playbooks for <xref href="create-rhel-vms.dita"/>, followed by the specific playbooks for RHEL worker nodes outlined below: 
</p>  
  
<ul>
	
<li><codeph>playbooks/scale_workers.yml</codeph> installs and configures additional Linux workers 
on the target nodes defined by the group <codeph>worker</codeph> in the <codeph>vm_hosts</codeph> inventory.</li>
  
</ul>
    
<p>A utility script <codeph>scale_worker.sh</codeph> is provided to assist you in adding worker nodes after the initial deployment.</p>
